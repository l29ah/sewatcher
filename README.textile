h1. Parser and notifier for Shadow Empire save files

"Shadow Empire":https://www.matrixgames.com/game/shadow-empire is an interesting, but poorly written game. Only multiplayer it supports is Play By EMail, and it does not feature any real security in it.

So, one can play improvised play-by-cloud games using sync tools like "syncthing":https://syncthing.net, but how to notify other players to make their turn?

One solution would be to watch for file changes, but 1. SE overwrites file on load for no reason at all, thus making sync noise, 2. What if there are more than two players?

This Linux tool watches a directory given as first argument for changes to .se1 files, parses save files when they arrive for turn number, and notifies you using @notify-send@ when your turn is up. To be notified of your turn only, add strings like "save.se1:3" to your command line, where "save.se1" is save name and 3 is your number.

h2. Known Issues

The parser is kludgey and relies on you using the default random planet scenario.

h2. What is the password to Shadow Empire save files?

Shadow Empire saves are ZIP archives with single serialized file. Password is "GarfieldJonesCat".
