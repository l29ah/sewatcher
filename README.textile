h1. Parser and notifier for Shadow Empire save files

Shadow Empire is an interesting, but extremely poorly written game. Only multiplayer it supports is Play By EMail, and it does not feature any real security in it.

So, one can play games using sync tools like syncthing, but how to notify other players to make their turn?

This Linux tool watches a directory given as first argument for changes to .se1 files (moved_to, as synthing does it) and notifies you using @notify-send@ when your turn is up. To be notified of your turn only, add "save.se1.me" file with your turn number.

h2. What is the password to Shadow Empire save files?

Shadow Empire saves are ZIP archives with single serialized file. Password is "GarfieldJonesCat".
